# webpack-starter
Fresh Install of webpack, babel, react using only instructions from the website


# 3/19/2019 Buidl of Webpack.

* CSS Modules

Due to the nature of webpack changing so fast, I'm keeping this nomianl feature set of bundling. It breaks too fast for me to keep
up at times.

I will be checking in with a vanilla wepback build every once in a while.

The same core features apply:

* babel proposal class properties for => binding during React based class functions
* babel common js for the export/require conversion that takes place.
